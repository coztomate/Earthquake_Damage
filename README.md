# Damage grade prediciton for buildings based on the Gorkah Earthquake

## Introduction


"Alright, fellow data explorers! Imagine we're like earthquake detectives in Nepal. Our mission? To cook up a super cool 'Damage No-More' prediction model for the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. 🌏🔮 We're gonna crunch numbers, dance with data, and create the ultimate crystal ball to foresee building damage. Let's get our geek on and predict the future, one earthquake at a time!" 😄📊🏢


## Technology Stack

Pandas: Our trusty spellbook for data manipulation – it's like a magic wand that lets us summon, sort, and shape data with a flick of the wrist. 📊🔮
NumPy: The enchanted potion master! With its mystical arrays and math spells, it turns numbers into pure gold (or at least meaningful insights). 🧪🪄
TensorFlow: The dragon tamer of deep learning! It's like having a pet dragon that we can train to do our bidding, from recognizing images to understanding words. 🐉🤖
Category Encoders: Our secret language translator. It helps us decode the cryptic messages of categorical data, so our algorithms can understand and work their magic. 🗝️🤫
Scikit-Learn (sklearn): Our Swiss Army knife of machine learning. It's got all the tools we need to solve any data mystery, from classifying creatures to predicting treasure locations. 🦉🗺️
XGBoost: The turbocharged racing broomstick for predictive modeling! It zooms through data forests, helping us make lightning-fast predictions and win the Quidditch Cup of machine learning. 🏇🏆
Optuna: The genie in a bottle granting wishes for the perfect model! It takes care of the tedious task of finding the right settings so we can focus on our magic spells. 🧞🪔
