## Introduction

In this section, extrapolate a bit on the content of your project. This section should be rich in detail, including the purpose of the project, the needs it addresses, and the methods used to address those needs.

## Data

Describe your data. Talk about your sources, the way the data is structured and any issues particular to the data such as missing data and how you dealt with it.

## Technology Stack

- Python
- pandas: a library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for Python
- Numpy: a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
- scikit-learn: for machine learning
- matplotlib/seaborn: for visualizations
- Jupyter Notebook: An open-source web application to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

## Setup

Detail the steps necessary to run the project. These can include specific software to install, how to get an API key, what data to download, and so on. Make sure to document every step such that any user can clone the repo and get the code running on any system.

## Analysis

Discuss the analysis steps you have conducted on the dataset. This can include exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, model evaluation, optimization methods, etc.

## Results

This will contain the results in detail. Preferably use both visual and text-based communication.
